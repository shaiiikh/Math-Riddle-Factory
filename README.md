# Math Riddle Factory

## Project Overview

The **Math Riddle Factory** project focuses on fine-tuning an AI model to generate math riddles. The goal is to create a system that can generate engaging and challenging math riddles like “What number becomes zero when you subtract 15 from half of it?”

The model used in this project is **TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0**, which was fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 30 riddles and solutions. The fine-tuning process utilized **Unsloth** and **LoRA** techniques for efficient training and memory optimization.

## Goal

- **Fine-tune a model** to generate **math riddles**.
- Generate **relevant and accurate riddles** that are logical and engaging.

## Files in the Repository

- **fine-tuned-OA-tinyllama-1.1B**: Folder containing the fine-tuned model for generating riddles.
- **outputs/**: Folder containing the generated riddles and output files.
- **LICENSE**: License file for the project.
- **Q1.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the fine-tuning process and experimentation.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the Math Riddle Factory project.
- **app.py**: Python file for the Streamlit-based web interface.
- **best_riddles.docx**: File containing the 3 best riddles and their solutions.
- **best_riddles.py**: Python script for generating and selecting the best riddles.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Steps

### 1. Dataset Creation
- Created a dataset of 30 **simple riddles** with solutions. These riddles were either manually crafted or generated using **ChatGPT**.

### 2. Fine-Tuning
- Used the **TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0** model and fine-tuned it on the riddles dataset for **2-3 epochs**.
- Fine-tuning was done using **Unsloth** for an efficient training process, and **LoRA** for optimizing memory usage during training.

### 3. Testing
- Generated **5 new riddles** from the fine-tuned model and verified if the answers were correct and the riddles made sense.

## Deliverables

- 3 best riddles generated by the model, along with their solutions, are available in **best_riddles.docx**.

### Example Riddles:

1. **Riddle**: "What number becomes zero when you subtract 15 from half of it?"
   - **Solution**: 30

2. **Riddle**: "What is 2 times the difference between 15 and 5?"
   - **Solution**: 20

3. **Riddle**: "If I have 12 apples and give you half of them, how many apples do I have left?"
   - **Solution**: 6
